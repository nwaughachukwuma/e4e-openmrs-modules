To configure the registration form, You'd have to do the following:
1. Go to Admin -> Manage Apps, and stop the in-built form app.
2. Click the button at the top left to add new custom app.
3. Name the app, and include the JSON for your version of registration app. See "patient registration app.txt" in the parent folder for a sample.
4. Save the JSON app, and there you have your form.

I have used a module called lfhc forms module to enable the creation of advanced features in the form. Look at the file; using the "lfhc module.txt"
